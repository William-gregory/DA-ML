# Deep learning of systematic sea ice model errors from data assimilation increments

This repository contains code and data relating to work as part of the M2LInES project, which involves developing climate model parameterizations using machine learning, in order to reduce systematic model biases. Here we use Convolutional Neural Networks to derive a mapping from model state variables to sea ice concentration analysis increments from an ice-ocean data assimilation. The model which this study has been applied to is the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) Seamless system for Prediction and EArth system Research (SPEAR) model. A manuscript detailing this work is in preparation, and will be submitted to the Journal of Advancements in Model Earth Systems (JAMES) in due course.

The networks have been trained here using `PyTorch'
