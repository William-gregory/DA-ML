# Deep learning of state-dependent sea ice model errors from data assimilation increments

This repository contains code and data relating to work as part of the [M2LInES](https://m2lines.github.io) project, which involves developing climate model parameterizations using machine learning, in order to reduce systematic model biases. Here we use Convolutional Neural Networks to derive a mapping from model state variables to sea ice concentration analysis increments from an ice-ocean data assimilation (see [Zhang et al., 2021](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/clim/34/6/JCLI-D-20-0469.1.xml) for details on the data assimilation experiment). The model which this study has been applied to is the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) Seamless system for Prediction and EArth system Research (SPEAR) model. A manuscript detailing this work is in preparation, and will be submitted to the Journal of Advancements in Model Earth Systems (JAMES) in due course.

### Network Training

For details on the data pre-processing, network architectures, and cross-validation testing, please see the code in the `DA-ML.ipynb` notebook. Dependencies for the code include:

`PyTorch`\
`Xarray`\
`Cartopy`

The optimized weights for each network are saved in the `CNN_weights` folder. Weights labelled 'CV' are those generated from cross-validation experiments to assess the network's generalization performance. Those labelled 'allsamples' have been trained using all data points, and should be used for subsequent analysis.

### Data

The data used to train the networks, as outlined in the paper, are hosted on a permanent ftp server: `ftp://sftp.gfdl.noaa.gov/perm/William.Gregory/`. The inputs to the network are saved as `seaice_DA-ML_inputs_1982-2017.nc`, while the outputs (increments) are `seaice_DA-ML_outputs_1982-2017.nc`. These can be directly downloaded with e.g., `wget` (see jupyter notebook).
