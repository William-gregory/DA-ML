Data assimilation is often viewed as a framework for correcting short-term error growth in dynamical climate model forecasts. When viewed on the time scales of climate however, these short-term corrections, or analysis increments, closely mirror the systematic bias patterns of the dynamical model. In this study, we use Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to learn a mapping from model state variables to analysis increments, in order to showcase the feasibility of a data-driven model parameterization which can predict state-dependent model errors. We undertake this problem using an ice-ocean data assimilation system within the fully coupled Seamless system for Prediction and EArth system Research (SPEAR) model at the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory, which assimilates satellite observations of sea ice concentration every 5 days between 1982--2017. The CNN then takes inputs of data assimilation forecast states and tendencies, and makes predictions of the corresponding sea ice concentration increments. Specifically, the inputs are sea ice concentration, sea-surface temperature, ice velocities, ice thickness, net shortwave radiation, ice-surface skin temperature, and sea-surface salinity.
